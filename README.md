CS-320 Software Testing and Automation


    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    UNit tests and desk testing. I won't submit anything unless every path has been followed to ensure good working code. 
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    Check requirements, ask the customer. 
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    Check the requirements, make a base program, then modularize it. FOr instance in this assignment I made a function for the requirements not null and a certain length. Parameterized the length, and it was reusable in
    multiple other projects thereafter.
